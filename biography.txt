hello! this is just an extended bio for anyone who has no clue who i am

i am k01e on most platforms
you may also know me by dev, dev_k, k01e-01, and my real name, which i won't share here
(btw, my real name is spelt with "ie" NOT "y")

i am 14 at the time of writing
anyone here looking to pay me, don't let that discourage you, put me through an interview first

i am residing in Australia
specifically AEST/AEDT time 
i should be available between 16:00 and 23:00 local time on any given day

i am transfem, but no, my dms are not a complaints box
if you want to complain, the perfect place to do it is into the trash bin

i am a web developer specialising in backend development using typescript
while i am no artist, i can also do frontend work
i know python, javascript, typescript, and can handle the basics of most other languages
i can also take advantage of most common npm libraries

i am open to dms, as long as you have a reason, and that reason makes sense
otherwise, please don't send me anything if you don't already know me in real life

i am done writing :)
